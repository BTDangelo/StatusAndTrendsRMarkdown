Greater Harney Basin,"No monitoring stations have recent continuous data, sufficient to calculate the 7DADM. Monitoring station 12264 had sufficient data to calculate the 7DADM for temperature in 2000 and 2001, but not since. ",Two monitoring stations (12264 and 33929) had sufficient data to assess water quality status and trends in pH within the Greater Harney Basin AgWQ Management Area. Both stations had insignificant trends and no exceedances of the water quality standard during the timeframe. ,"Two monitoring stations (12264 and 33929) had data from 2012 ? 2016 and therefore sufficient data to assess water quality status, but not enough to assess trends in bacteria. Monitoring station 33929 had no exceedances of the water quality standard from 2012 to 2016, while station 12264 had multiple exceedances during the entire timeframe. There was not enough data to calculate the geometric mean for either monitoring station.",Two monitoring stations (12264 and 33929) had sufficient grab sample data to assess water quality status and trends in the Greater Harney Basin AgWQ Management Area.

Station 33929 had data from 2006 ? 2017 but not enough unique years of data to calculate trend. ,"Little data exists in the Greater Harney Basin AgWQ Management Area to assess water quality status and trends. There is no continuous temperature data from 2001 forward, which gives little insight into natural and anthropogenic contributions to water temperature. "
Greater Harney Basin,,,,,,,"Continuous temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH data would be useful in this AgWQ Management Area in order to understand diurnal fluctuations. "
Greater Harney Basin,,,,,,,"Additional data is needed to evaluate site potential vegetation on the agricultural land, which would require remote sensing data to determine tree heights and calculate effective shade."
Walla Walla,"There is insufficient data to calculate the seven day average daily maximum and therefore assess status and/or trends of temperature in the Walla Walla AgWQ Management Area. Continuous (sufficient for calculating was collected at multiple stations between 2000 and 2003), but since temperature grab samples have been collected (the 7DADM cannot be calculated from temperature grab samples). Since no monitoring stations have greater than eight years of continuous temperature data and/or recent data, there are no stations that fit the criteria to assess status and/or trends in the Walla Walla AgWQ Management Area. See the Interactive Status and Trends Document (Appendix) for complete list of monitoring stations and the number of results per year.",One monitoring station had sufficient data to assess water quality status in relation to pH results in the Walla Walla AgWQ Management Area.

Monitoring station 36786 has data from 2011-2017 and has exceedances of the dissolved oxygen water quality standard during that timeframe and within the last two years (2015-2017).,One monitoring station (36786) has total phosphorus data in the Walla Walla AgWQ Management Area. There is no TMDL in this basin and therefore the data is not compared to a standard or TMDL load allocation. ,One monitoring station (36786) has total suspended solids data in the Walla Walla AgWQ Management Area. There is no TMDL in this basin and therefore the data is not compared to a standard or TMDL load allocation.,"Little data exists in the Walla Walla AgWQ Management Area that is sufficient to assess water quality status and trends. One monitoring station has sufficient data to assess water quality status for E. coli, pH, and dissolved oxygen. There is no continuous temperature data and therefore insufficient data to assess the temperature water quality status and trends in relation to the water quality standard and TMDL load allocations."
Walla Walla,,,,,,,"Additional data is needed to evaluate site potential vegetation on the agricultural land, which would require remote sensing data to determine tree heights and calculate effective shade."
Walla Walla,,,,,,,The monitoring station with sufficient data to assess status and/or trends does not give a representative analysis of the Walla AgWQ Management Area

Yamhill,"Four monitoring stations (USGS 14197900, USGS 14192015, 10363, and 10948) have sufficient data to calculate the temperature seven day average daily maximum (7DADM) and compare results to the water quality criteria within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. All monitoring stations have exceedances of the water quality criteria within the last two years of available data. None of the monitoring stations have significant trends. The USGS monitoring stations have continuous data.","Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess status and/or trends of pH within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. The results for station 10363 have decreasing (degrading) trends and there are exceedances of the pH water quality criteria within the last two years (2015-2017) of data. Stations 10929 and 10948 do not have significant trends and do not have any exceedances of the water quality criteria during the last two years of data (2015-2017).","Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess status and/or trends of E. coli within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. Stations 10363 and 10948 do not have enough data to calculate the geometric mean for determining water quality status during the entire timeframe (2000-2017). None of the monitoring stations had significant trends and all had at least one exceedance of the water quality criteria within the last two years of data (2015-2017).","Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess status and/or trends of dissolved oxygen within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area.

All monitoring stations had consistent exceedances of the TMDL load allocation of 0.07 mg/l through the entire timeframe.","Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess trends of total suspended solids within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. Stations 10498 and 10929 had significant trends; station 10948 displays significant steady trends, while 10929 displays significant increasing (degrading) trends. Data was not compared to a TMDL load allocation since one has not been developed for the Middle Willamette or Yamill Subbasins.",Monitoring stations with sufficient data to assess status and/or trends do not display spatial homogeneity within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area.
Yamhill,,,,,,,"No monitoring stations that fit the criteria to assess status and/or trends have continuous dissolved oxygen or pH data, which is useful to understand the diurnal fluctuations."
Yamhill,,,,,,,"All monitoring stations with total phosphorus data have exceedances of the TMDL load allocation, expressed in the 1992 Yamhill Subbasin TMDL."
Yamhill,,,,,,,"All five monitoring stations are located on larger streams. Four of the five stations exceeded the temperature status (last two years of available data). For the Middle Willamette, stations are not representative of the implementation statrigies identified in the Temperature TMDL for smaller streams."
